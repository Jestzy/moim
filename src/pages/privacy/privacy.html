      <b>Privacy Policy </b><br><br>

      Moim Privacy Policy was updated on May 1, 2019.
      
      Your privacy is important to Moim and always has been. So we’ve developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we use and store your information. 
      Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and let us know if you have any questions.
      
     <br><br><br><b> Use of Personal Information</b><br><br>
      
      Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.
      
      You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Moim. Moim may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. You are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have.
      
      Here are some examples of the types of personal information Moim may collect and how we may use it:
      
      <br><br><br><b> What personal information we may collect</b><br><br>
      
      When you create a Moim ID, contact us or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, and other information you provide.
      
      When you share your content with friends using Moim products, or invite others to participate in Moim services, Moim may collect the information you provide about those people such as email address. Moim will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes.
      
      In the U.S. and some countries, we may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of managing reservations, or as required by law.
      
      
      <br><br><br><b>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</b><br><br>
      
      We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:
      
      We may collect information such as language, unique device identifier, location, and the time zone where a Moim product is used so that we can improve our products, services, and advertising.
      
      We may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries. This information may be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services. Except in limited instances to ensure quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP address.
      
      If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.
      
      <br><br><br><b>Cookies and Other Technologies</b><br><br>
      
      Moim, interactive applications, may use “cookies” and other technologies. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our application people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and app usage. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non‑personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
      
      As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files.
